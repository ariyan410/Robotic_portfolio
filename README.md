# 1. Chassis build
* Built the frame
* Mounted motors, axles and wheels

# 2. Testing
* Temporarily mounted the brain, battery and transmitter to test the motors
* And its a success!

# 3. Permanent mount
* Built a case below the motors and added battery clips
* Mounted the brain, battery and the transmitter permanently

# 4. The grabber
* Built the frame for the grabber
* Attached motors and tracks with clips on it
* The clips on the track hits a screw while moving which causes friction

# 6. Modified grabber
* Modified and refined the frame of the grabber using more aluminum
* The motors have changed sides, went to the other side
* The motors are directly connected to the tracks from the other side

# 7. Modified grabber pt2
* This picture shows the tracks and more clips added onto it
